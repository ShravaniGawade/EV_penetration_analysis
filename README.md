# Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing the market size of electric vehicles (EVs) using Python. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a series of visualizations to understand trends in EV registrations, model popularity, and electric range distribution. The project also predicts the future growth of EV registrations using an exponential function.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted an in-depth EDA to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Data Visualization:

EV Registrations by Model Year: Visualized the number of EVs registered each year to identify trends.
Top 3 Counties Based on EV Registrations: Selected the top 3 counties and analyzed the distribution of EVs within their cities.
Popularity of EV Manufacturers and Models: Analyzed the most popular EV manufacturers and models among registered vehicles.
Top Models in Top 3 Makes: Identified the leading models within the top 3 most popular EV makes.
Electric Range Distribution: Examined the distribution of electric ranges across different models.
Electric Range by Model Year: Calculated and visualized the average electric range by model year.
Top 10 Models with Average Electric Range in Top Makes: Highlighted the top 10 models with the highest average electric range among the top EV manufacturers.

Predictive Analysis:

EV Registration Growth Prediction: Calculated the number of EVs registered each year and used an exponential function to predict the future growth rate of EV registrations.

Technologies Used:
Python: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating graphs and visualizations.

Conclusion:
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the electric vehicles market, offering insights into registration trends, model popularity, and electric range advancements. The future growth prediction highlights the potential expansion of the EV market in the coming years.
